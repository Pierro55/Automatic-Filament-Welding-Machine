The filament sensor has the purposes to locate the filament position on various locations in the machine. 
The sensor housing uses a compliant mechanism to trigger the mechanical endstop when filament is detected. 
A grooved bearing makes the system bidirectional to ensure that filament can travel back and forth without getting pinched resulting in a jam.

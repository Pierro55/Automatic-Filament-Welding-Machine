## What is this?
This is an automatic filament welding machine. Its purpose is to weld left over filament and wind it on a spool afterwards. 

## General information
I designed and build this machine as part of my mechanical engineering bachelor thesis. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to program it and test it thoroughly but tested every single subsystem of the machine itself. The welding itself works really well. 
All parts are modular and interchangeable. I’ve attached my thesis report which goes into every little detail of the design and building process. It is written in Dutch but translating it should be doable. Maybe I will add an English version in the near future if I get enough requests (or maybe somebody else is so kind to translate it). If you can understand Dutch please read it with a grain of salt as Dutch isn’t my first language. I will roughly describe every process in English in this readme.

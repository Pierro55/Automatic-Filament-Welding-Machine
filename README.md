## What is this?
This is an automatic filament welding machine made for 3mm (or 2.85mm) filament. Its purpose is to weld left over filament and wind it on a spool afterwards. The system can be adapted for 1.75mm if needed. 

## General information
I've designed and build this machine as part of my mechanical engineering bachelor thesis. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to program it and test it thoroughly but tested every single subsystem of the machine itself. The welding part itself works really well. 
All parts are modular and interchangeable. I’ve attached my thesis report which goes into every little detail of the design and building process. It is written in Dutch but translating it should be doable. Maybe I will add an English version in the near future if I get enough requests (or maybe somebody else is so kind to translate it). If you can understand Dutch please read it with a grain of salt as Dutch isn’t my first language. I will roughly describe every process in English in each folder.
I don't have the machine on hand because I have built it for a company so I cannot make it fully working unfortunately as I don’t have the financial medium to build one myself (roughly 1000 Euros, including experiments and everything). Nevertheless, I wanted to make this open source as I have learned a lot through the open source movement about 3D printing and I wanted to give something back to the community.

## Work in Progress
Please notice that this reprository is work in progress at this moment as it takes quite a bit time setting up everything neatly.

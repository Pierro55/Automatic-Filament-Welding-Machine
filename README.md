# Automatic-Filament-Welding-Machine

##What is this?
This is an automatic filament welding machine. Its purpose is to weld left over filament and wind it on a spool afterwards. 

##General information
I designed and build this machine as part of my mechanical engineering bachelor thesis. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to program it and test it thoroughly but tested every single subsystem of the machine itself. The welding itself works really well. 
All parts are modular and interchangeable. I’ve attached my thesis report which goes into every little detail of the design and building process. It is written in Dutch but translating it should be doable. Maybe I will add an English version in the near future if I get enough requests (or maybe somebody else is so kind to translate it). If you can understand Dutch please read it with a grain of salt as Dutch isn’t my first language.

The cutting system is designed to cut off the filament ends before welding them togethers to make the machine more reliable. In my experiments I used a geared DC motor for this which turned out to be too weak. I therefore had to ditch it for the final machine as there wasn’t enough time left. It can still be added to the machine because of its modularity.

The extruder has the purpose of moving filament through the system. In the final machine, two extruders are used as both ends of filaments needs to be moved individually.

This extruder design uses original Bondtech hardware (hobbed gears, shafts, bearings, 5:1 geared motor...). The housing is 3D printed. 
This design uses 3mm filament.

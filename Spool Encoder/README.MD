# Spool encoder
This part of the machine keeps track of the material on the spool. This is needed to get information on when the spool is full and also for setting the right winding speed. 

It is basically an arm which sits directly on the spool. The axis of this arm is connected to a potentiometer. As material builds up, the arm goes up and therefore the value of the potentiometer changes. This value gets converted in the software and can be used for said purposes. 

It can be mounted to a 20x20 aluminum extrusion profile.
For ease of use when unmounting a spool, a latch is included in the design to hold the arm up while changing spools.

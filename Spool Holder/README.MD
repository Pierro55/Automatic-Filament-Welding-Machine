# Spool Holder

This part of the machine is designed to drive the winding action and to accept various types of filaments spools. It self-centers the spool when mounting it on the device. It uses a small Nema 17 motor with some gears to beef it up as no fast speeds are needed. It can fit bigger spools when using a longer shaft.

## Tensile Tester

This device is just an add on and not neccescarily needed for the machine. I've build it to be able to measure the tensile strength of normal filament and compare the result with my welded filament to get somwhat sientific data showing the strentgh of the seam.

I've designed this inspired by other already existing devices. Becuase I like things organized, I've also created a storage box which is not included in the files (I can upload it if there is any interest in it).

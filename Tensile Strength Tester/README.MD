## Tensile Tester

This device is just an addon and not needed for the machine. I've built it to be able to measure the tensile strength of normal filament and compare the result with my welded filament to get somewhat scientific data showing the strength of the seam.

I've designed this inspired by other already existing devices. Because I like things organized, I've also created a storage box which is not included in the files (I can upload it if there is any interest in it).

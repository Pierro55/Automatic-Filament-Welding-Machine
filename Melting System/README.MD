# Melting System

The melting system can weld two pieces of filament together and also cool the weld afterwards. A first movement test can be seen in the following video:

The melt zone itself is made out of PTFE with a honed inner surface of 2.9mm in diameter. The system functions basically as a hotend seen on FDM 3D printers. It has a hot zone and an active cooled cold zone. Two clamps are moved simultaneously to either enabling welding or cooling. 
A result of the welding process can be seen in the following picture:
